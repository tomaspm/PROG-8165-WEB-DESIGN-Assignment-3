We need to implement validation for the pages Login, Registration and Transaction Entry that we have created for assignment 2.
Validations are to be implemented using regualr expressions.

Created the branch js for dealing with javascript files. Collaborators may push javascript files for validation to js branch.


Akshay may work with login page validation
Marss may work with Registartion page validation.

I am going to work with transaction entry page validation.
